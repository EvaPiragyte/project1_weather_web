# Weather Comparison Service

A lightweight Node.js service that provides current weather data for cities and enables comparison of temperatures between two cities. This service leverages the WeatherStack API to fetch real-time weather information, available in both JSON and HTML formats.

## Features

- **Weather Data Fetching**: Retrieve the current temperature, weather description, wind speed, and humidity for a specified city.
- **City Temperature Comparison**: Compare temperatures between two cities to determine which is warmer or colder.
- **Flexible Response Formats**: Supports both JSON and HTML responses for easy integration and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **WeatherStack API Key** - Sign up at [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/) to obtain an API key.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your WeatherStack API Key:
   - Replace `WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY` in the code with your personal key.
