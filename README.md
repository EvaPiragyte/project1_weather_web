# Weather Comparison Service

A web service created to demonstrate the ability to use the WeatherStack API to fetch and compare current weather information between cities. This service was implemented using Node.js and provides responses in both HTML and JSON formats. Users can control the functionality through URL parameters.

## Features

- **Weather Data Fetching**: Retrieve the current temperature, weather description, wind speed, and humidity for a specified city.
- **City Temperature Comparison**: Compare temperatures between two cities to determine which is warmer or colder.
- **Flexible Response Formats**: Supports both JSON and HTML responses for easy integration and visualization.
